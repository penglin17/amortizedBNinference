# amortizedBNinference
Thank you for your intetest of the paper " performing Bayesian network inference using amortized region approximation with graph factorization". 
The instruction for the code can be found in the readme file of the .zip package. The testing models are .txt files included in the package, which can also be modified in the BNM class. 
There are examples (i.e., 5x5grid.txt) available for easy trying out. You can also switch between the mode of using amortized Bethe/Kikuchi(PWC-LSRG) in the BNM class. The code is under futher improvments.
