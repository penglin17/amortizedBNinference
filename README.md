# amortizedBNinference
Thank you for your intetest for the paper " performing Bayesian network inference using amortized region approximation with graph factorization". 
The instruction for the code can be found in the readme file of the .zip package. The testing models are .txt files also in the package, which can be modified in the BNM class. 
There are examples (i.e., 5x5grid.txt) available for easy starting. You can also switch between the mode of using amortized Bethe/Kikuchi(PWC-LSRG) in the BNM class. The code is also under futher development for improvments.
