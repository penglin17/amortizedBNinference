# amortizedBNinference
Thank you for your intetest for the paper " performing Bayesian network inference using amortized region approximation with graph factorization". 
The instucion for the code can be found in the readme file. The testing models are .txt files in the package, which can be changed in the BNM class. 
There are examples 5x5grid.txt for easy starting. You can also switch between the mode of using amotized Bethe/Kikuchi in the BNM class.
